This project implements recursive algorithms to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem using different numbers of pegs. The goal is to move all disks from a source peg to a destination peg while adhering to the rules of the game: only one disk can be moved at a time, and no larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. The program calculates the minimum number of moves required for configurations involving both three and four pegs, demonstrating the efficiency gained by adding an extra peg in the solution process.
